      <h2 class="title">Sagada Blue soil hills</h2>
      <p class="card-paragraph">The Blue Soil Hills is probably one of Sagada’s best kept secrets. It’s tucked within the mountainous 
        terrains of thousand old limestones. As its name suggests, it is a roll of hills in a lovely color of faint blue no bigger
        than a square kilometer surrounded by towering pine trees. This stunner is evidence that despite Sagada’s quick rise to 
        fame instantly becoming a tourist hubspot, there is still a less explored place up there where you can enjoy a time of 
        peace and quiet.</p>
